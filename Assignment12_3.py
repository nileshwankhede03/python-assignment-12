# 3. Write a program which contains one class named as Arithmetic. 
# Arithmetic class contains three instance variables as Value1, Value2. 
# Inside init method initialise all instance variables to 0. 
# There are three instance methods inside class as Accept(), Addition(), Subtraction(), Multiplication(), Division(). 
# Accept method will accept value of Value1 and Value2 from user. 
# Addition() method will perform addition of Value1, Value2 and return result. 
# Subtraction() method will perform subtraction of Value1,Value2 and return result. 
# Multiplication() method will perform multiplication of Value1, Value2 and return result. 
# Division() method will perform division of Value1, Value2 and return result. 
# After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
